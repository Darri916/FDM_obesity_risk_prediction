KEY INSIGHTS:
1. BMI strongly correlates with obesity classification
2. Physical activity shows inverse relationship with obesity
3. Family history is a significant indicator
4. Technology use correlates with sedentary lifestyle
5. Transportation mode impacts obesity levels

DATA QUALITY:
✓ No missing values
✓ No duplicate rows
✓ All features have valid ranges
✓ Dataset is ready for modeling

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Create BMI feature (critical indicator)
- Engineer lifestyle composite scores
- Handle class imbalance if needed
- Use ensemble methods for better performance
